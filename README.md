# Embejayz Org

## Welcome to Embeejayz's GitHub Repository!

Welcome, Embeejayz supporters, Twitch community members, and anyone passionate about gaming! This monorepo houses the various applications and tools that support Embeejayz's stream and the content we share. We truly appreciate any collaboration or contributions you make to these projects. Our goal is to create a safe, inclusive, and fun environment for everyone, just as it is for us.

While this project is primarily focused on Embeejayz and his connection with T1 Esports, we welcome all fans – whether you're from G2 Esports, Gen.G, KT Rolster, or any other team. Our aim is to make this a safe space for all supporters, no matter which team you cheer for.

We encourage any developer to fork, clone, or adapt these projects for their own streams or personal projects. It would make us happy to see our projects mentioned in your work, but there's absolutely no obligation. Most importantly, we encourage you to explore, contribute, and support the diverse ideas that help grow and enrich this ecosystem of projects we’ve created.

We look forward to your involvement and contributions!
